# YoutubeMusicRecommendation
This project is a Content-Based Music Recommendation System built using Python, Pandas, and Streamlit. It recommends 10 similar songs based on a user-input song title or a dropdown selection. The system uses preprocessed metadata and cosine similarity for recommendation. The app is interactive and deployed via Streamlit.
